# crossgrid-assignment

Problem Statement:
Your task is to develop a Command Line Interface (CLI) that accepts a list of numbers and returns them in sorted order. Utilize a bubble sort implementation sourced from a random answer on Stack Exchange via the Stack Exchange API.

In simpler terms, once you receive the input numbers, your CLI should call the Stack Exchange API, retrieve a random answer to any question regarding bubble sort implementation, and execute the code blindly, passing in the user input. Finally, display the sorted list to the end user.

Sample output:
>> Hello! Please provide a list of integers.
>> 4, 51, 62, 45, 31, 90, 42, 28, 96, 65, 33, 73
>> Thanks. Fetching a random bubble sort implementation. Fingers crossed.
>> 4, 28, 31, 33, 42, 45, 51, 62, 65, 73, 90, 96
